 * 3Com 10/100 PCI Server NIC w/3XP (3CR990SVR97) 
   This NIC has PCI device ID of 9909 (in hexadecimal)
 * 3Com 10/100 PCI Server NIC w/3XP (3C990BSVR) 
   This NIC has PCI device ID of 990A (in hexadecimal)

The 3c590/3c592/3c595/3c597 and 3C905 Families are supported
with the 3c59x driver from Donald Becker.


* Getting the Sources
---------------------

    Sources are in the file 3c990-1.0.0a.tar.gz. This file can be obtained
    from http://www.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/linuxdownload.htm
 
* Unzipping the Sources
-----------------------

    To unzip the 3c990-1.0.0a.tar.gz, run the command -

    #tar zxvf 3c990-1.0.0a.tar.gz 
 
* Building the Driver as a Module
----------------------------------

    To build the 3c990 driver as a loadable module, you can either: 
    + make
      to build the driver for the Uni-processor machine
    + make up 
      to build the driver for Uni-processor machine
    + make smp
      to build the driver for SMP (symmetric multi-processor) machine

    + Compile the 3c990.c source file with the following command:

	gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes \
        -I/usr/src/linux/include -O6 -c 3c990.c \
        `[ -f /usr/include/linux/modversions.h ] && echo -DMODVERSIONS`

    Additionally, you can modify this compile line by:
    + Adding -D__SMP__ to the command line for SMP support
    + Adding -I/usr/src/linux/include to the command line if you've
      upgraded the kernel (assuming kernel source is in /usr/src/linux/include)        
    
* Installing Driver as a Module
--------------------------------
      
    To load the 3C990 driver module on a RedHat 6.1  or 6.2 system, 
    place an "alias" in the file named /etc/conf.modules.  
    
    The alias instructs the kernel module loader to use the 
    3C990 driver module for a specific Linux Ethernet interface.  
    When the system attempts to use this Ethernet interface, it 
    causes the kernel module loader to load the 3c990 driver
    into the system automatically, and initialize it for use.
    
    The alias listed below associates the Ethernet device "eth0" with
    the 3c990 driver module.  If you have one of the EtherLink NICs
    that is supported by the driver, place the following line in the
    /etc/conf.modules file:

	    alias eth0 3c990

    To enable additional supported EtherLink NICs, create additional 
    aliases, such as:

    	    alias eth1 3c990
	    alias eth2 3c990

    To install a loadable module by hand, enter the following command:
    
    	#insmod 3c990.o

    Note: If PATH does not include current directory and module is in
          the current directory, use 
 
	#insmod ./3c990.o 

    
* Configuration options for the Driver Module
---------------------------------------------------------

    The 3C990 driver supports the following options, which can be 
    supplied as command line arguments to the insmod command or in the 
    /etc/conf.modules file.  Unless otherwise stated, all settings take 
    the form of:
    	
    force=value [,value ]
	
    value can be 
        1) 0        [10 Megabit Half Duplex]
        2) 1        [10 Megabit Full Duplex]
        3) 2        [100 Megabit Half Duplex]
        4) 3        [100 Megabit Full Duplex]
        5) 4        [Default option: Auto]

    NOTE:  If you use the conf.modules file to load the driver at
    boot time, include the word "options" when configuring the driver.
    For example:  options 3c990 force=0
	
    If you use command line insmod, do not include the word "option"
    when configuring the driver.  For example:  #insmod ./3c990.o force=0
    will force the 10 Megabit half duplex settings. 
    If you have multiple adapters, settings can be done by specifying the 
    value of force for each adapter. For example -
    a) #insmod ./3c990.o force=0,2 
       This will force the settings for first NIC to 10 Megabit Half Duplex 
       and the second NIC to 100 Megabit Full duplex.
    b) #insmod ./3c990.o force=0,,3
       This will force the settings for first NIC to 10 Megabit Half Duplex,
       second NIC to autonegotiation and third NIC to 100Megabit Half Duplex.
